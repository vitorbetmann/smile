# SMILE Engine ðŸ˜Š: Modular Tools for 2D Game Development in C

## What is SMILE?

SMILE stands for **State Machine is Lowkey Elegant**.

Itâ€™s a modular collection of tools designed to simplify 2D game development in C. Built on top of [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) for rendering, sound, input, and window management, SMILE aims to provide a lightweight and extensible foundation for developers at all skill levels.

Ideal for rapid prototyping, learning C through small games, or game jam entries where full control without bloat is desired.

---

### Mission

SMILE is built to be open, accessible, and inviting â€” a place where developers at all stages can learn and grow through real-world programming experience.

Whether you're a university student in your first few semesters, a self-taught coder building your first engine, or a professional branching into new areas like graphics or game systems, SMILE welcomes contributors who are curious, motivated, and eager to improve.

The engine is designed to grow gradually through thoughtful community involvement, with a focus on learning, clarity, and steady improvement â€” not rushing to build everything at once.

## âœ¨ Features

- Lightweight and modular C engine
- Simple state machine system
- Flexible particle system for visual effects
- No dynamic memory allocation required by the user

---

## ðŸ“¦ Included Modules

SMILE is modularâ€”include only what you need.

Current modules:

- **StateMachine**: A clean and efficient way to manage game states and transitions.
- **ParticleSystem**: A simple but flexible system for effects like explosions, smoke, and more.
- _More modules coming soon!_

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before building SMILE, ensure the following are installed:

- CMake version 3.16 or higher
- A build tool such as Ninja or Make
- A C compiler (e.g., Clang or GCC)

### Clone and Build

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/vitorbetmann/smile_engine.git
cd smile_engine
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build # or ninja -C build
```

This builds libsmile.a â€” a static library that includes the StateMachine and ParticleSystem modules by default.

Your Source Directory should now look something like this:

```zsh
/my_game_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.c                # Your game's entry point
â””â”€â”€ smile_engine/         # SMILE cloned or copied here
    â”œâ”€â”€ include/
    â”œâ”€â”€ StateMachine/
    â”œâ”€â”€ ParticleSystem/
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## ðŸŽ® Building Your Game with SMILE

There are two common ways to compile your game using SMILE:

**With Clang:**

```zsh
# From your source directory, run:
clang main.c -Ismile_engine/include -Lsmile_engine/build -lsmile -o my_game
```

If needed, replace `my_game` with the desired output name and/or `main.c` with your entry source file.

**With CMake:**

Your Source Directory should look similar to this:

```zsh
/my_game_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt        # Your game's CMake file
â”œâ”€â”€ main.c                # Your game's entry point
â””â”€â”€ smile_engine/         # SMILE cloned or copied here
```

In your `CMakeLists.txt`, add:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
project(my_game C)

# Add SMILE engine as a subdirectory
add_subdirectory(smile_engine)

# Create your game executable
add_executable(my_game main.c)

# Include SMILE headers
target_include_directories(my_game PRIVATE
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/smile_engine/include
)

# Link against the SMILE library target
target_link_libraries(my_game PRIVATE smile)
```

Don't forget to replace `my_game` with the name of your project's executable, if applicable.

## Contributions Welcome

SMILE is a place to learn, experiment, and grow â€” especially if you're still early in your programming journey.

### SMILE might be the right place for you if you're:

- A first-year computer science student curious about how game engines work.
- An experienced web developer looking to explore graphics.
- A self-taught programmer looking to get more comfortable with GitHub, unit testing, or contributing to open source projects.
- None of the above â€” just someone eager to learn something new.

### What do you need to get started?

Just a willingness to learn. Thatâ€™s it.

SMILE is designed to be approachable, collaborative, and beginner-friendly â€” while still aiming to grow into something powerful and extensible over time.

There are many ways to contribute:

- Fixing bugs or suggesting improvements
- Adding small features or new modules
- Writing or editing documentation
- Asking questions, sharing insights, or helping others learn

This is a space to build skills, grow confidence, and collaborate on something meaningful.  
Whether you're here to level up your C programming, explore game dev concepts, or just try something new â€” you're welcome here. ðŸ˜Š
