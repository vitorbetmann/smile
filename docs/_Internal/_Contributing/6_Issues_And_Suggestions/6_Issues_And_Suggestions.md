### 🤖 Using AI Tools

- AI can be a helpful assistant—just remember to use it to support your
  learning, not replace it.
- Whether you're learning to code, write documentation, plan architecture, or
  design tests, try doing it yourself first.
- Use AI to review, suggest, or guide you, especially when you're stuck or want
  a second opinion.
- This isn't mandatory – but if you're here to grow, you'll only be cheating
  yourself.

## 🔖 Issue Tags to Look For
